# DD-GCN
Source code for "[A High Accuracy and Adaptive Anomaly Detection Model With Dual-Domain Graph Convolutional Network for Insider Threat Detection]"

# Environment Settings 
* python == 3.7   
* Pytorch == 1.1.0  
* Numpy == 1.16.2  
* SciPy == 1.3.1  
* Networkx == 2.4

# Usage 
````
python main.py -d dataset -l labelrate
````
* **dataset**: including cert, required.  
* **labelrate**: including \[20, 40, 60\], required.

# Data
## Link
**Cert R4.2 & 6.2**: (https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247)  
For graph date processing, we first process the original citesee dataset and replace associated fiels with ours.
For cert behavior data processing, please refer:

## Usage
 The files in folders are as follows:
````
cert/
├─cert4.2.edge: edge file.  
├─cert4.2.feature: feature file.  
├─cert4.2.label: label file.  
├─testL/C.txt: test file. L/C, i.e., Label pre Class, L/C = 20, 40, 60.   
├─trainL/C.txt: train file. L/C, i.e., Label pre Class, L/C = 20, 40, 60.
